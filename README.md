# Magic 8 Ball
A Magic 8 Ball app done in Flutter

This is an exercise from AppBrewery's [course](https://www.appbrewery.co/courses/intro-to-flutter) Intro to Flutter

## Description

Create a Magic 8 Ball application with provided designs where the user would tap on the magic 8 ball to get one of the 5 pre-selected random answers.

For this project I took the liberty to use **Shake** library instead of button, allowing the user to shake their phones instead pressing a button which is closer to the experience of playing with a Magic 8 Ball.
